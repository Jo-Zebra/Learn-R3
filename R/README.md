# Description of R/ folder and .R files

This folder contains custom functions or R scripts used for this project's
analyses, such as in the `doc/` folder. Each R script is split up into
sections (e.g. with RStudio's 'Insert Section' with Ctrl-Shift-R) by
utility or purpose. You can use the 'Document Outline' (Ctrl-Shift-O)
to see the sections and functions.
